		<pre>    Put chicken breast (thawed, frozen, cooked, it doesn't matter much)<br />into a frying pan. Add water until they are about 3/4 covered. Add ketchup, <br />BBQ sauce and ranch dressing and stir up. Cook until water is mostly boiled<br />out, stiring occasionally. Remove chicken and cut into about 1 in. chunks.<br />Put back in pan and add beans and cook for another twenty minutes on <br />medium low.<br /><br />    Meanwhile, prepare rice according to directions on package and place in a <br />13 by 9 inch pan, spreading until it forms a layer. Add the chicken and <br />beans mixture on top, then let cool for a few minutes.<br /><br />    Serve with shredded cheese on top or on tortillas with cheese as well.<br />    <br />    Note: The 13 by 9 inch pan is not necessary, the parts can be mixed in <br />a bowl just as easily.</pre>
